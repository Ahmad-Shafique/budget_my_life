A beautiful and informative budgeting Android app.

It's light-weight and all data stays on your device. The app requires no permissions from the user.

## Technologies Used
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) (SDK)
- [Codemagic](https://codemagic.io/) (CI/CD)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (editor)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (design tool)

## Installation and Setup
If you don't already have Flutter installed and an editor set up, do that [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install "Flutter Installation") and [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor "Editor Setup"). I use VSCode as the editor for this project and the stable Flutter channel.

After ensuring everything works with `flutter doctor`, clone the repo and run `flutter pub get` then `flutter run` to run the application on your device.
